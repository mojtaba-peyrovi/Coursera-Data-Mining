# Coursera Course for Data Mining:


## Data Visualization


### Week 1: The Computer and the Human

Data visualization is not just about seeing data. It's about understanding data and making decisions based on the data.


__Color coding:__ the process of deciding on colors and making decision on what color would be associated with which data.

in the example here: data-visualization.jpg   we say blue color is the faculty members who were the first choice of students, orange second and green third. By a glimpse on the chart we see that the first half alphabetical members where chosen as the first choice and the second half were picked as the last choice.

- It shows that the drop downs where student had to pick faculty members from, shouldn't be sorted by alphabetical order.

This is one of the uses of data visualization, to get the insight that we need to improve the design of the online form.


#### Types of data visualization:

- Mathematical visualization: data results from mathematics
Fractals or Julia sets are some examples of mathematical visualization. example: factal-or-julia-set.jpg
- Scientific visualization: These data come from scientific tools that measure real data based on real-world situations, or based on expensive scientific simulators.
- Information visualization: comes from more abstract sources, like relationship data. It requires some sort of processing on the abstract data to make them ready to be understood. A bit more challenging than the other types of visualization.

#### Domains of data visualization:
- medical imaging; CT scan, etc.
- Business Intelligence
- Educational visualization
- Geographic information systems

In most of data visualization tasks we use 2D graphics.

__Vector shapes vs raster shapres:__

Raster shapes are pixelated shapes, whereas vectorized ones are not working on pixel system.

__Rasterization:__
The process of converting the vector to a raster image. here is the example: rasterization.jpg

__Parabola: شلجمی__

#### Types of coordinates:

- Canvas coordinate system: we can see in the photo: canvas-coordinates.jpg
- Hierarchical coordinate system: there is a canvas within a canvas.  hierarchical-coordinate-system.jpg
- Screen coordinates: used for raster graphics.


One of the tools we can use to make vectors is making SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)
photo: svg-canvas.jpg and svg-within-svg.jpg

We can make a path by svg. photo: svg-path.jpg  (in the photo M means move without drawing a line, and L means move with drawing a line, also d means data)

photo: svg-closed-path.JPG  in this photo Z means close the path.
